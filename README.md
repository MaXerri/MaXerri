## About Me
- Hi, I’m Mario Xerri, a recent graduate of Cornell University, with a bachelors in CS and a minor in applied mathematics and am currently getting my MS CS at Stony Brook University.
- I’m interested in solving optimization problems using machine learning and statistical models.  
- For more information about my projects / work experience / education visit my github pages website pinned under my profile.

## Prior Projects: 
   - 2D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) Model
       - Collaborated with two other students to train and develop a visual transformer deep learning model for single-person human position estimation using PyTorch.
       - Devleloping a CI/CD pipeline to automate future model deployments.
         
   - LLM Technical Analysis Trader (September - October 2024)
        - Collaborated with two other students in a month long hackathon tackling the question: "How can LLMs be leveraged to outperform the S&P 500?"
        - Develop an online learning algorithm to fine-tune the Chronos-T5 time series LLM for portfolio optimization of the S&P 500.

   - Minesweeper in OCaml (Spring 2023)
        - Collaborated with two other students in the development of a completely function implementation of Minesweeper in OCaml which can be played in the terminal.
        - Moves were parsed as commands within the terminal and game states were displayed after each mode
