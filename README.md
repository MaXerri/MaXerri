- Hi, I’m @MaXerri I am a computer science student minoring in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics at Cornell University, within the College of Engineering. 
- I’m interested in implementing software for mechanical-related systems and solving optimization problems using machine learning systems.  I'm always open to opportunities for computational-related work in new fields.  
- Current Projects:
   - making deep learning models for human joint position estimation for a software to analyze running mechanics
- My past work experiences includes:
   - making deep learning models for more efficient object detection for sparse event-based camera data
   - research in macromolecular crystallography, where I implemented C++ scripts for converting to new unit cell representations
