- Hi, I’m Mario Xerri, a computer science student at Cornell University specializing in machine learning systems and software engineering. 
- I’m interested in implementing software for mechanical-related systems and solving optimization problems using machine learning systems.  I'm always open to opportunities for computational-related work in new fields.

# Current Projects:
   - making deep learning models for human joint position estimation for a software to analyze running mechanics
# Prior Research 
   - Summer 2023:
        -  making deep learning models for more efficient object detection for sparse event-based camera data
   - Summer 2022: research in macromolecular crystallography, where I implemented C++ scripts for converting to new unit cell representations
